SuperToasts Library
=================

The SuperToasts library is an enhancement of the stock Android Toast class. This library offers developers new ways of communicating with their users. The idea
for this library came from the [UndoBar Library](https://code.google.com/p/romannurik-code/source/browse/misc/undobar)
and the [Crouton Library](https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/Crouton).


This is a Beta release, expect bugs.

Demo Application
================
A simple demo application is available on Google Play. This demo application does not showcase all of the libraries functions 
rather it is a short demonstration of major features/functions of the library.
