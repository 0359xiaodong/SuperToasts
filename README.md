SuperToasts Library
=================

The SuperToasts library is a customizable way for a developer to interact with his/her users. 
This library seeks to give developers a better way of communicating with their users. The idea
for this library came from the [UndoBar Library](https://code.google.com/p/romannurik-code/source/browse/misc/undobar)
and the [Crouton Library](https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/Crouton).


PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS LIBRARY IS NOT YET READY FOR PRODUCTION AND IS UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT.
