===============================

https://code.google.com/p/supertoasts


	The SuperToasts library for Android is a collection of customizable message systems meant to replace or augment stock APIs. There are six variations of the SuperToast: SuperActivityToasts, SuperToasts, SuperImageToasts, SuperProgressToasts, SuperButtonToasts, and SuperCardToasts. Each variation presents developers with a particular type of usefulness. Please visit the Google Code webpage for examples and information.
